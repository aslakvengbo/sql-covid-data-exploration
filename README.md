# sql-covid-data-exploration
SQL data exploration of a data set containing information about covid-19.

The data set "covidData" can be found in the repo. Due to file size restricitions at GitHub (max 25 MB), I have only included 75 000 out of the original 233 517 data rows. 

The data was collected from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths on the 9th of November 2022.
